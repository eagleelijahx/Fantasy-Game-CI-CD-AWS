* Fantasy RPG Assignment: Object Oriented Programming, this game allows the user to select and play as one                 *
* of the two characters (a warrior or a hunter). The character has three different fields (health, fame, and money).       *
* The player must keep all of these fields above 0 in order to survive.                                                    *
* Having 0 fame is just social media death, but that still matters in this game.                                           *
* Character s stats will each be measured by an integer. EACH "DAY" the player plays will DECREASE EVERY STAT by 3 points. *
* The player can INCREASE one of these STATS EACH DAY by selecting ONE of three options:                                   *
* hunt for food;                                                                                                           *
* fight monsters;                                                                                                          *
* search for treasure;                                                                                                     *
* Each option functions slightly differently in the way that it increases the player's stats.                              *
